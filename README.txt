What is available: 
1. Instrumentation aspect for SMS, Calls, Network and Location privacy policy (PeLogger.aj)
2. Instrumentation framework (Unpackaginng, repackaging, weaving and re-signing) â€” you can take a look at all the python scripts in AspectJ dir
3. Dockerfile for creating docker container
4. PHP server scripts for accepting apk and dynamic class
5. Test App - Helloworld.apk

What is missing:
1. PE-Client
2. Dynamic class advice
3. Update tracking module

Issues on ground: If an app exceeds 64K methods the instrumentation engine breaks. Working on a fix to dynamically weave advice instead of static weaving.
